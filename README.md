If someone is interested I've tried to create a project which could predict when to buy and when to sell on betfair exchange. It should work thanks to AI and machine learning techniques I've tried. Also it should learn from previous matches which I've collected data about? from the betfair using my own proxy on webshare.io. So the program fist collects the data from every minute of a soccer match, then it stores every match in the project. I have 166 matches. Data contains every minute and the BACK / LAY price at that minute, also team names and other potentially useful data like liquidity i think etc. I've tried 2 approaches. First was to predict based on linear regression and the second one to predict from some genetical or so algorithm. I figured that they probably made something like this and they did made some bots which you can find on betfair website so no point in maintaining this one, I can just try those bots.
